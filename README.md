Solutino to adding aws

I found that the answer Jerinaw sourced from the AWS forum didn't work for me. I had to do it a little different (Indigo Java EE IDE) :

Details:

    Launch the new software installer in Eclipse (Help -> Install New Software...)

    In the "Work with:" field fill in the url according to your Eclipse version.

    http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo

    http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler

    http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna

    The address should already be in the "Work with:" drop-down.

    Click on the check box next to "Database Development" (click next, accept license, click finish, should be prompted for restart).

    Launch the new software installer and in the "work with:" field enter http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse

    Select the packages you please and install
